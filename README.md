# Cryptography Pen-Testing Project (pwn.college)

This project focuses on **penetration testing in cryptographic systems**, using a variety of tools:

- **Pwntools**: for automating input sending and output retrieval.  
- **cURL**: for extracting data from databases.  
- **Mathematical operations**: like XOR bitwise manipulation, applied to Many-time Pad AES.

## Objectives

The main goal is to gain hands-on experience with encryption and decryption algorithms, as demonstrated in the [pwn.college Cryptography Course](https://pwn.college/cse365-f2024/cryptography/) and various **CTF challenges** (e.g., picoCTF). The project also explores **real-world applications** by combining cryptographic attacks with web exploitation techniques (e.g., SQL injection).

## Cryptographic Algorithms Covered

- **Encoding & Simple Ciphers**: XOR, Hex, Base64  
- **Symmetric Encryption**: One-time Pad, Many-time Pad AES (ECB, CBC, CPA, POA)  
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE â†’ AES), RSA  
- **Hashing & Integrity**: SHA (various versions)

## Additional Topics

- Performing **TLS handshakes** (using Pwntools) with self-signed root certificates and private keys.  
- Deriving **AES-128 keys** from exchanged secrets in secure communications.
