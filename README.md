# Cryptography Pen-testing Project (pwn.college):
I primarily conducting penetration tests using pwntools (automated input sender and output receiver), curl (retrieving data from database), mathematics calculation (XOR bitwise operator on Many-time Pad AES). The main purposes of the projects is to get used to common encryption and decryption algorithms, which are demonstrated in [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/cse365-f2024/cryptography/) and many ctf challenges from picoCTF, and apply it to real world scenario that combined with other web exploitation techniques (like SQL injection for example) on various cryptographic algorithms: XOR, Hex, Base64, One-time Pad, Many-time Pad AES (ECB, CBC, CPA, POA), DHKE (to AES), RSA, and SHA.
Additionally, I learned how to perform TLS handshakes (using pwntools) with self-signed root certificates and private keys, deriving AES-128 keys from the exchanged secrets.
